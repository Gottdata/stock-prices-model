In this project, I worked on cleaning, analyzing, and creating prediction models based on stock data. The key tasks included:

- Data Cleaning: Extracted data from Yahoo Finance and handled missing values and outliers to ensure the dataset's quality.
- Historical Price Analysis: Analyzed Googleâ€™s historical stock prices to identify trends and patterns over time.
- Trend Analysis: Explored stock price movements and market trends, leveraging statistical methods to understand underlying behaviors.
- Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and test sets to ensure the robustness and validity of the predictive models.
- Modeling: Tested and compared various forecasting models, including ARIMA, GARCH, and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to predict future stock price movements.

This project helped me to apply various data analysis techniques and build predictive models using financial data, further strengthening my skills in time series analysis and machine learning.
